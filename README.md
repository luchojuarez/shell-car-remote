## Disclaimer

All reverse engineering insights were sourced from [Shell Motorsport Bluetooth Remote Control](https://gist.github.com/scrool/e79d6a4cb50c26499746f4fe473b3768), an excellent cheat sheet for this project.

## run
```make start```

## Controller Mapping

### DualShock Mapping

- **Right Analog Stick**: Controls right/left directions.
- **PS Button**: Toggles headlights.
- **Left Trigger**: Moves forward (press more than 40% for turbo).
- **Right Trigger**: Moves backward (press more than 40% for turbo).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Developers' Zone Starts Here ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Key features
+ Scan, pair, and control the Brandbase Bluetooth RC battery car.
+ Capability to control RC car with:
  + **DualShock 4**: using github.com/mrasband/ps4 (evdev under the hood... **LINUX ONLY**).
  + **Keyboard**: using golang-evdev (**LINUX ONLY**), this is only for debug developed as a POC (*DUE TO ITS CONTENT IT SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY ANYONE* üòÇ)

## implement other input?
in `input/input.go` you can find
```go type Input interface {  
 Listen() *chan Command}  
```  
to implement other input device you need to implement your input device interface.  
this implementation will send into a channel all inputs to `chan Command`  
where
```go  
type Command struct {  
 Key   KeyCommand Value ValueCommand}  
```  
And use this `Command chan` as a parameter to build your car.
```go  
xboxController := input.NewXBoxInput(controller)  
ch := xboxController.Listen()  
car, err := service.NewQCar(*cipher, BLEcar.Devices(), ch)  
```
## Todo list
+ Implement keyboard again.
+ Read car battery status from characteristic. (feature well documented in cheatsheet üòè)
